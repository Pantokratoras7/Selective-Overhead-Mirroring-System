# Selective-Overhead-Mirroring-System
A selective overhead mirroring system, simulating an online server system. This system is consisted of many online (localhost) program which, cooperatively, manage to copy a number of remote directories to a specific device. The parallel data transfer is accomplished through threads, while using sockets for server and mirrors communication. This project has been implemented for the UNIX System Programming course, in Departments of Informatics and Telecommunications, at University of Athens, Greece. The project workpaper is in greek, such as Readme file, however, both pictures on pdf and comments on code are enough to give the general impression of my implementation.
